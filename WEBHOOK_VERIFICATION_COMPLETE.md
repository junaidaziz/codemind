```bash
curl -X GET https://codemind-delta.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vercel-deployment
```

**Response:**
```json

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-vercel-signature: invalid" \
  -d '{"type":"deployment.created","payload":{}}'
```

## ðŸ“Š What This Means

### âœ… Webhook is Fully Configured
1. **Endpoint is deployed** and accessible at your production URL
2. **VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET** is properly set in Vercel environment
3. **Signature verification** is working (prevents unauthorized webhook calls)
4. **All required events** are subscribed (Created, Error, Succeeded, Checks Failed)

### âœ… Auto-Fix System Ready
When a deployment fails:
1. Vercel sends webhook to your endpoint
2. Webhook handler verifies signature âœ…
3. Handler fetches deployment logs
4. Auto-fix system analyzes errors
5. Creates GitHub issue with analysis
6. Generates PR with fixes (if possible)

## ðŸ§ª Want to Test It?

### Option 1: Trigger Real Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change
git checkout -b test/webhook-live
