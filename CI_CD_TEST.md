# CI/CD Verification Test

**Date:** 16 October 2025  
**Purpose:** Verify GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline execution  
**Branch:** test/ci-cd-verification

## Test Objectives

This test branch is created to verify the complete CI/CD pipeline:

### 1. Quality Job ✓
- ESLint checks
- TypeScript type checking
- Security audit (npm audit)

### 2. Test Job ✓
- Jest unit tests
- Test coverage report
- Codecov upload
- Matrix testing (Node 18.x, 20.x)

### 3. E2E Job ✓
- Playwright end-to-end tests
- Test artifacts upload on failure

### 4. Build Job ✓
- Docker image build
- Snyk security scan
- Trivy container scan
- Image push to registry (main branch only)

### 5. Deploy Jobs ✓
- **Staging:** Auto-deploy on non-main branches
- **Production:** Deploy on main branch with approval
- Smoke tests after deployment
- Database migrations

## Expected Workflow Execution

```
Push to test/ci-cd-verification
  ↓
quality → test → e2e → build → deploy-staging
          (Node 18 & 20)
```
