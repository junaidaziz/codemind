### ⚙️ Global Type Rules (Apply to All Tasks)
- 🚫 **Do not** use `any` or implicit `unknown` types.  
- ✅ Prefer **inferred types** from Prisma (`typeof prisma.project.findUnique`) and OpenAI SDK.  
- ✅ Use **Zod** schemas for request validation → derive TypeScript types from them (`z.infer`).  
- ✅ Define all interfaces in `/types/` folder and import instead of inline types.  
- ✅ Enable `"strict": true` and `"noImplicitAny": true` in `tsconfig.json`.  
- ✅ Type all function params, return values, and responses.  
- ✅ Use `ResponseType` or `ApiResponse<T>` generics in API routes.
