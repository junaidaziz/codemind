## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2 ‚Äî AutoFix & Audit Intelligence (Q2 2026)

**üéØ Goal:** Enable AI to automatically generate and implement fixes for compliance violations, closing the development loop.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

1.  **Fix Suggestion Generator**
    * **Patch Generation:** Reuse **Smart Scaffolder's** underlying LLM to generate compliant patch suggestions (`suggestedFixSnippet`).
    * **Format Enforcement:** Ensure the AI output adheres to the **unified diff format** or a detailed replacement object for programmatic application.

2.  **APR AutoFix Integration ("Fix It" Button)**
    * **Integration:** Integrate the structured compliance fix output into the **Autonomous PR Creation (APR)** workflow.
    * **Atomic PRs:** When the user clicks the "Fix It" button, trigger the APR to create a single-commit PR titled: `fix: [Violation ID] (AI Autogenerated)`.
    * **Safety:** Add a mandatory human **approval step** before merge.

3.  **Severity & Confidence Scoring**
    * **Confidence Scoring:** The Lambda worker must populate the `confidence` field in the `ComplianceFinding` model (Float 0.0 - 1.0) based on the LLM's certainty.
    * **Dashboard:** Color-code results based on Severity and Confidence.

4.  **Compliance Trend Analytics**
    * **API Route:** Create a new route `/api/compliance/summary` using Prisma's aggregation (`groupBy`) for performance trend data.
    * **Charts:** Integrate trend charts in `/analytics/compliance` showing *violations per day* and *average time to fix*.

5.  **Notification Hooks**
    * **Email:** Integrate **Resend** for email notifications when jobs complete.
    * **Slack:** Integrate **Slack webhooks** for critical failure alerts.

## üìä Phase 3 ‚Äî Predictive Insights (Q3 2026)

**üéØ Goal:** Add predictive and managerial analytics to move beyond reactive reporting.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

* **Metrics Tracking:** Track granular metrics (e.g., LCR: Lines of Code Reviewed, Time to Fix) in a `compliance_metrics` table.
* **Predictive ML Service:** Build a basic ML service (regression) to forecast PR violations.
* **Code Health Scoring:** Implement a visible score: `(complexity + tests + rule compliance)`.
* **Data Export:** Enable CSV/JSON export of all compliance reports.

---

## üß± Phase 4 ‚Äî Enterprise Governance (Q4 2026)

**üéØ Goal:** Add collaboration, RBAC, and centralized financial control.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

* **RBAC Extension:** Extend `User` and `Workspace` models with `ADMIN`, `DEV`, and `VIEWER` roles.
* **Role Enforcement:** Implement role-based access to compliance dashboards and "Fix It" features.
* **Metered Billing:** Implement metered billing using **Stripe** tied to the **`AiJob`** model completion count.
* **Organization Overview:** Add an org-level compliance overview at `/org/compliance`.
* **Audit Logging:** Add a full audit log export feature.

---

## ‚ö° Phase 5 ‚Äî AI Optimization (Q1 2027)

**üéØ Goal:** Optimize LLM cost and performance.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

* **Batch Processing:** Batch multiple file diffs into a single **OpenAI** API call to optimize cost.
* **Embedding Cache:** Implement **Redis/Vercel KV** caching of compliance rule embeddings.
* **LLM Router:** Add logic to choose the most cost-effective model (GPT-4o-mini for style, GPT-4o for security).
* **Cost Tracking Dashboard:** Build a dashboard to track AI token usage and cost per workspace.
* **Streaming:** Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets to stream audit progress to the front-end.

---

## üß© Phase 6 ‚Äî Ecosystem Expansion (Q2‚ÄìQ3 2027)

**üéØ Goal:** Expand compliance intelligence to external platforms.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

* **VS Code Extension:** Build the extension with inline compliance feedback and the "Fix It" button integrated into the editor.
* **Public API:** Expose `/api/public/compliance` with secure API tokens.
* **SDK:** Create an SDK for external integrations.
* **Mobile Summary:** Add mobile-friendly compliance summary views.
* **Plugin Marketplace:** Launch a marketplace for community rule sets.
