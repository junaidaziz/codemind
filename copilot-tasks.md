## üéØ ACTIVE ROADMAP (Completed items removed)

### **Current Focus: Feature #11 ‚Äì Code Review Automation**
Priority: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CORE DIFFERENTIATOR | Effort (remaining): ~3 weeks

Remaining High-Impact Tasks:
1. Persist & expose review simulation (affected components + dependency surface) ‚è≥
2. Persist & surface documentation/testing suggestions in UI ‚è≥
3. Integration tests: analyze endpoint + webhook end‚Äëto‚Äëend ‚è≥
4. Minimal UI: PR review list + detail view (risk, comments, suggestions, simulation) ‚è≥
5. Incremental re-analysis optimization (selective file refresh + improved duplicate suppression) ‚è≥
6. Adaptive GitHub API backoff + shared response caching ‚è≥

Secondary Enhancements (Backlog):
- Parallel file analysis worker pool
- Configurable rule weights (user overrides)
- Slack/Discord notification on completed reviews

### **Next Up: Feature #10 ‚Äì CI/CD & DevOps Integration**
Early Scope (defer until Feature #11 core shipped):
- GitHub Actions integration: pre-merge AI check job
- Deployment event ingestion (Vercel) ‚Üí summarize build & risk
- Post-deploy health scan & rollback suggestion draft

### **Future (Watchlist)**
Feature #9: VS Code Extension (trigger only after demand threshold)
Feature #15: Performance & Cost Optimization (activate post real usage metrics)

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Junaid Aziz**
