# 🤖 CodeMind Copilot Task — AI PR & Issue Manager

Enable CodeMind to **list GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** for each linked project,  
and allow users to **auto-resolve issues** using the AI agent — which generates code fixes and creates Pull Requests automatically.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Display all **open Pull Requests** for a connected GitHub project.  
2. Display all **open Issues** for the same project.  
3. Add a **"Resolve with AI"** action button beside each issue.  
4. When clicked, the **CodeMind Agent**:
   - Fetches the issue context.
   - Generates a potential fix.
   - Commits changes to a new branch.
   - Opens a Pull Request automatically.
5. Keep the dashboard updated via **GitHub Webhooks**.

---

## 🧩 Main Components

1. **Backend GitHub Integration Layer**
   - Create helper methods to:
     - Fetch Pull Requests.
     - Fetch Issues.
     - Create new Pull Requests.
   - Use Octokit and GitHub App installation token for authentication.
   - Store linked repository info in the database (owner, repo name, installation ID).

2. **API Routes (Backend Services)**
   - `/api/github/pull-requests` — Returns list of PRs for a project.
   - `/api/github/issues` — Returns list of issues.
   - `/api/github/resolve` — Triggers AI fix generation and PR creation.
   - Use OpenAI API or LangChain logic to generate code suggestions.

3. **Frontend (Project Detail Page)**
   - Add two new sections:
     - **Pull Requests List** — Displays open PRs with title, branch, and status.
     - **Issues List** — Displays open issues with title, body, and “Resolve” button.
   - When a user clicks “Resolve with AI”, send request to `/api/github/resolve`.

4. **GitHub Webhook Integration**
   - Create a webhook endpoint (e.g. `/api/github/webhook`).
   - Handle events:
     - `pull_request`
     - `issues`
     - `push`
   - Update the local database whenever a PR or issue changes.

5. **Database Updates**
   - Add `PullRequest` and `Issue` tables in Prisma schema.
   - Each record should be linked to a project.
   - Store metadata: number, title, body, URL, state, timestamps, etc.

6. **AI Fix Generator**
   - Implement an internal helper that:
     - Takes issue title and body.
     - Generates a proposed fix or patch using OpenAI API.
     - Optionally commits fix to GitHub via the app’s access token.
   - Provide traceability (log AI decisions in DB or S3).

7. **Environment Configuration**
   - Ensure these secrets are configured:
     - `GITHUB_APP_ID`
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
     - `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`
     - `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
     - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
     - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
     - `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` (optional for personal)
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

8. **GitHub Actions Workflow (Optional Automation)**
   - Create a workflow that triggers when:
     - An issue is labeled `ai-fix`
     - Or manually via workflow dispatch.
   - It should call the `/api/github/resolve` endpoint automatically.
   - Optionally deploy new builds via Vercel when a fix PR is created.

9. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Use consistent layout for PRs and Issues.
   - Add loading indicators for API fetch.
   - Display success toast/alert after AI fix triggers.
   - Optionally show PR link after successful creation.
   - Make dark/light mode compatible with existing dashboard theme.

10. **Testing & Validation**
    - Verify PRs and Issues load correctly for connected repos.
    - Confirm that AI-generated PRs appear under user’s repo.
    - Test webhook updates (PR merged, issue closed).
    - Ensure all API routes require authentication and are rate-limited.

11. **Security & Permissions**
    - Use GitHub App installation tokens, not personal tokens.
    - Avoid exposing secrets in frontend requests.
    - Verify webhook signature with `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
    - Limit OpenAI fix generation to specific user roles (e.g. owner, admin).

12. **Acceptance Criteria**
    - [x] Dashboard lists open PRs and Issues for each project.
    - [x] "Resolve with AI" triggers automatic PR creation.
    - [x] Webhooks sync issue and PR state changes in real-time.
    - [x] All API keys and secrets are securely stored.
    - [x] UI feedback confirms fix or PR creation success.
    - [x] CodeMind agent can process issue → fix → PR flow end-to-end.

13. **Future Enhancements**
    - AI posts comments in PR explaining the fix.
    - Auto-merge PRs after CI passes.
    - Add PR diff preview before submission.
    - Add AI “review suggestions” for other PRs.
    - Enable issue categorization by complexity or component.
