### üß© Task: Improve Authentication Flow and Header Behavior

**Goal:**  
Enhance user experience and authentication flow by refining password reset logic, header visibility, and navigation consistency across public and logged-in areas.

---

##### 1. **Forgot Password Email Validation**
- [ ] Update `/api/auth/forgot-password` logic to **send reset email only if the email exists in the database**.  
- [ ] Prevent leaking user existence ‚Äî return a **generic success message** (e.g., ‚ÄúIf this email is registered, you will receive a reset link‚Äù).  
- [ ] Log failed attempts securely (no sensitive info exposed).  
- [ ] Ensure Supabase Auth or custom token-based reset flow is correctly used.  
- [ ] Test both registered and unregistered email flows.

---

##### 2. **Hide Public Header for Logged-In Users**
- [ ] When user is authenticated, **hide the public header** (the one with Home, About, Contact links).  
- [ ] Instead, display the **user header/navigation** containing:
  - Dashboard  
  - Projects  
  - Profile  
  - Logout  
- [ ] Implement this check using session data (e.g., Supabase session or JWT context).

---

##### 3. **Unified Logo Across All Headers**
- [ ] Use the **same logo component** from the public header (`<Logo />`) in both public and authenticated headers.  
- [ ] Centralize logo in `/components/shared/Logo.tsx`.  
- [ ] Remove duplicate logo imports to ensure brand consistency.

---

##### 4. **Add ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù Link to User Menu**
- [ ] In the user dropdown menu (top-right corner of the authenticated header), add an option:
