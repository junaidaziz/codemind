## 🎉 What's Next?

**Choose one of the options and let's start building!**

My recommendation: Start with **Smart Scaffolder Mode** for maximum impact and natural progression from the command console.

Once you decide, I can:
1. Create detailed implementation plan
2. Set up project structure
3. Start coding the core architecture
4. Track progress in a new markdown file

**Ready to build something amazing?** Let's do this! 🚀
