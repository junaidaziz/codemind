## 🔥 What Makes This Powerful

### 1. **Natural Language Interface**
No need to remember commands or syntax:
- "Merge PR #42" vs `gh pr merge 42`
- "Add bug label to issue #15" vs `gh issue edit 15 --add-label bug`

### 2. **Context-Aware**
AI understands your intent:
- "Merge the PR" - figures out which PR from context
- "Add security label" - knows whether it's PR or issue

### 3. **Multi-Step Workflows**
Chain operations naturally:
- "Create issue, assign to alice, and add bug label"
- "Merge all approved PRs"

### 4. **Error Prevention**
Built-in safety checks:
- Won't merge PRs with conflicts
- Validates branch existence
- Checks permissions

- **Refactoring:** "Refactor UserService to use async/await"

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Run tests before merging
- Code quality checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated feedback in PR comments

### Phase 5: Advanced Workflows

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Be Specific with Numbers**
✅ "Merge PR #42"  
❌ "Merge the PR"

### 2. **Use Natural Language**
✅ "Add bug and critical labels to PR #50"  
✅ "Comment on issue #15 saying this is fixed"

### 3. **Check Status First**
✅ "Show all open PRs" before merging  
✅ "List PRs by alice" to review her work

### 4. **Combine Operations**
✅ "Create PR from feature/x to main and request review from bob"  
✅ "Add comment and approved label to PR #42"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "PR has conflicts and cannot be merged"
- **Solution:** Resolve conflicts in GitHub or locally first
- **Command:** `git pull origin main` → resolve conflicts → `git push`

### "GitHub token not configured"
- **Solution:** Go to Project Settings → Add GitHub token
- **Needs:** `repo` scope for full access

### "PR already merged"
- **Solution:** Check PR status first: "Show PR #42"
- **Note:** Cannot re-merge or unmerge PRs

### Comments not appearing
- **Solution:** Check PR/issue number is correct
- **Note:** Comments appear immediately on GitHub
