## üîß Technical Details

### Function Calling
The chat uses OpenAI's function calling feature to decide when to use tools. The AI:
1. Analyzes your message
2. Decides if a tool is needed
3. Calls the appropriate tool
4. Returns formatted results

### Tool Execution Flow
```
User Message ‚Üí AI Decision ‚Üí Tool Execution ‚Üí Result Formatting ‚Üí Response
```

### Enabling/Disabling
Function calling is **enabled by default**. To disable:
```javascript
// In chat request
{
  message: "your message",
  projectId: "...",
  useFunctionCalling: false  // Disable tools
}
```

---

## üé® UI Integration

### Chat Interface
- Tool executions show as system messages
- Loading indicators during tool execution
- Success/error notifications
- Formatted results with links

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Task dashboard showing all tasks from all sources
- [ ] Batch operations (create multiple issues)
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Webhook integration for real-time updates
- [ ] Custom tool creation via UI

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "GitHub token not configured"
