### Understanding Responses

CodeMind responses include:

1. **Main Answer**: Clear explanation in natural language
2. **Code Examples**: Relevant code snippets with syntax highlighting
3. **File References**: Direct links to the source files
4. **Related Information**: Additional context and connections

Example response:
```
The user authentication in this project uses JWT tokens with the following flow:

1. **Login Endpoint** (`src/auth/login.ts`):
   - Validates user credentials
   - Generates JWT token with user information
   - Sets secure HTTP-only cookie

2. **Authentication Middleware** (`src/middleware/auth.ts`):
   - Validates JWT token on protected routes
   - Adds user context to request object
   - Handles token refresh logic

Key files:
- `src/auth/login.ts` - Login logic and token generation
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` - Request authentication
- `src/models/User.ts` - User model and validation
```
