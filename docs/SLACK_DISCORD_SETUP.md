## üìã What You'll Get

Once configured, you'll receive notifications for:

‚úÖ **Deployment Success** - When your app deploys successfully  
‚ùå **Deployment Failures** - When builds fail with error details  
üîß **Auto-Fix Triggered** - When AI attempts to fix issues  
‚úÖ **Auto-Fix Success** - When AI successfully resolves problems  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Health Alerts** - When consecutive deployment failures detected

## üé® Notification Examples

### Slack Message Example
```
üöÄ Deployment Successful
Project: CodeMind
Environment: Production
Commit: feat: Add task management (abc123)
URL: https://codemind-delta.vercel.app
Duration: 45s
```

### Discord Embed Example
```
‚úÖ BUILD PASSED
codemind-delta.vercel.app
Deployed in 45s
View deployment ‚Üí
```

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit webhook URLs** to git
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done)
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

2. **Use different webhooks for different environments:**
   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_PROD=https://hooks.slack.com/services/PROD_WEBHOOK
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_STAGING=https://hooks.slack.com/services/STAGING_WEBHOOK
   ```

3. **Rotate webhooks if exposed:**
   - Slack: Delete and create new webhook
   - Discord: Regenerate webhook URL

---

## üß™ Testing Your Webhook

### Method 1: Use the test script
```bash
npm run notifications:test
```

### Method 2: Manual test with curl

**Slack:**
```bash
curl -X POST YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Test notification from CodeMind!"}'
```

**Discord:**
```bash
curl -X POST YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"Test notification from CodeMind!"}'
```

---

## üîó GitHub Actions Integration

### Add Webhook to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add one of:
   - Name: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, Value: `your_slack_webhook_url`
   - Name: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, Value: `your_discord_webhook_url`

### Example Workflow Usage

The webhook is automatically used in:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Deployment pipeline
- `.github/workflows/health-monitor.yml` - Health monitoring
- `scripts/monitor-deployment-health.js` - Deployment health checks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving messages

1. **Check webhook URL is correct:**
   ```bash
   cat .env | grep WEBHOOK
   ```

2. **Test webhook directly:**
   ```bash
   npm run notifications:test
   ```

3. **Check webhook status:**
   - Slack: Go to App Settings ‚Üí Incoming Webhooks
   - Discord: Go to Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks

### Webhook URL expired/invalid

**Slack:**
- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
- Select your app
- Go to "Incoming Webhooks"
- Delete old webhook and create new one

**Discord:**
- Go to Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
- Click on your webhook
- Click "Copy Webhook URL" (or delete and recreate)

### Messages not formatted correctly

The notification format follows platform standards:
- **Slack**: Uses Block Kit and attachments
- **Discord**: Uses embeds with color coding

If formatting is broken, ensure you're using the latest version of the notification script.
