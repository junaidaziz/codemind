## 🎯 Technical Details

### Header Component Architecture
```tsx
// Key Features Added:
- useState for dropdown state management
- useRef for dropdown element reference
- useEffect for click-outside detection
- User initials calculation from name/email
- Animated dropdown with SVG icons
- Proper event handling and cleanup
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```tsx
// Improved Pattern:
1. Set error to null before fetch
2. Try to parse error response from API
3. Check if empty array → informative message
4. Catch actual errors → detailed message
5. Console log for debugging
6. User-friendly display with actions
```

### Dashboard Features
```tsx
// Quick Actions Grid:
- 4 cards (Projects, Chat, APR, Activity)
- Each with emoji, title, description, and CTA
- Hover effects with shadow transitions
- Responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop

// Stats Overview:
- 3 stat cards (Projects, Messages, Sessions)
- Placeholder data (ready for API integration)
- Color-coded (blue, green, purple)

// Recent Activity:
- Preview section with Suspense
- Link to full activity feed
- Empty state with CTA
```
